# logseq-omnivore

This plugin helps you to read [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/) articles and highlights from Logseq.

## Features

- Read articles, highlights and labels from Omnivore
- Create graphs based on Omnivore data

## Installation

1. Install the plugin from the marketplace or build it from source and load unpacked plugin
2. Create an API key in [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/settings/api) for Logseq
3. Open settings and add your api key and username and how frequent you want the plugin to sync with Omnivore

## Usage

1. The plugin will automatically sync with Omnivore every time you open the plugin and every time you change the settings
2. You can also manually sync with Omnivore by clicking the Omnivore icon on the toolbar
3. You can also change the API key, username, and how often the plugin syncs with Omnivore by updating the settings
4. We will create a page "Omnivore" and a block for each article containing metadata like labels, nested with highlights underneath
5. Clicking on the article will open the Omnivore article in a new tab
6. We also create an internal link to each label in the article so you can group articles by label
